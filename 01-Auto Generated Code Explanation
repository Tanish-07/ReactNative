			01-simple demo app

Since, we know App.tsx is the main file

First:
We will try to understand the auto generated code by React-Native 

	import React from 'react';			//Here we are importing react
	import type {PropsWithChildren} from 'react';
	import {
  		SafeAreaView,               //Ensures that the content is rendered within the safe area boundaries of a device (e.g., avoiding notches and status bars).
  		ScrollView,                 //A scrollable container that can hold multiple child components and allows vertical scrolling.
  		StatusBar,                  //Manages the appearance of the status bar (e.g., style, background color).
  		StyleSheet,                 //Provides a way to create styles for your components.
  		Text,
  		useColorScheme,             //A hook that returns the current color scheme (light or dark mode).
  		View,                       //A container component that can hold other components and apply styles.
	} from 'react-native';

	import {                      //These imports are from the react-native/Libraries/NewAppScreen module, which is part of the default React Native template.    
  		Colors,
  		DebugInstructions,
  		Header,
  		LearnMoreLinks,
  		ReloadInstructions,
	} from 'react-native/Libraries/NewAppScreen';   

	export default App;
