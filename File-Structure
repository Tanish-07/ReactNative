				File Structure

__tests__
->App-test.tsx:
It's a kind of typescript file.
Help in testing apps, mostly they are written by the testers.

.bundle
->Config
These are just configuration files we never ever touch them.

android
Mostly we never go in 
->build.gradle
In future we would be coming in this file to make sdk versions, dependencies,and other stuff.
->local.properties
Here the path of android sdk is defined and sometime it isn't formed automatically then we have to make it.
	sdk.dir =/Users/apple/Library/Android/sdk				(for ios)
	sdk.dir = C\:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk		(for Windows)

ios
Mostly we never go in 
->Podfile
Here we install all of our new dependencies, packages.

node_modules
All the require dependencies that are required for our app liked to javascript is here
Sometime there are issues so just uninstall the file and re-install(npm install)

.gitignore
We add all the file here that aren't required to be pushed on github

.watchmanconfig
It give the feature of hot relode

app.json
Android, ios takes the name of the application from here

App.tsx(Major File)
Don't compare it with app.json, it is all the meat and potato of the app
Study it in next chapter in depth

babel.config.js
Metro is used in it
Just like all other bundlers, it combines all the file and make it runnable for the browsers, mobiles.

Gemfile
Again a ruby baised file for ios development

tsconfig.json
It's a type script configuration file which allows us to have strong types and somebody needs me to tell from where I shoud get these types, this file help us in that task

package.json
Contain all the dependencies

index.js
The first file which is open by metro builder is this file i.e. first file to be open
	import {AppRegistry} from 'react-native';
	import App from './App';					//App.tsx is called here
	import {name as appName} from './app.json';			//Imports the file name from app.json

	AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App);		//This says first file to open up is appName which is taken from App
